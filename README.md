[00:18.56] 
[00:15.36] So I party like a rockstar, look like a pornstar
[00:19.72] Every day I go hard, riding in my sports car
[00:23.64] Pull off in that V8, songs on replay
[00:27.42] Spinnin' like a DJ, make it look easy
[00:45.92] 
[00:30.77] 'Cause I go faster and harder, faster and harder
[00:35.01] I go faster and harder, bitch, I feel like a monster
[00:38.75] I go faster and harder, f-f-f-faster and harder
[00:42.98] I go faster and harder, I-I-I feel like a monster
[01:07.48] 
[00:47.13] We turning up, we don't give a fuck
[00:48.99] And we live it up, you can't get with us
[00:51.05] I just need a buzz, let me roll it up
[00:52.96] In the Bentley truck with a 2-liter
[01:10.46] 
[00:54.91] I look I'm J-WOW
[00:56.78] D-d-dance like I'm Deena
[00:58.97] 'Cause I'm feeling so scene
[01:00.59] And you're just giving John Cena
[01:16.59] 
[01:02.81] 'Cause no one can see ya, when their eyes are on me
[01:06.60] Yeah, I'm your strange addiction, just like TLC
[01:09.92] (Ah) you can't come into my crib, this ain't MTV
[01:14.39] I feel like SUICIDAL-IDOL, too much ecstasy
[01:35.89] 
[01:17.96] P-p-p-p-party like a rockstar, look like a pornstar
[01:22.92] Every day I go hard, riding in my sports car
[01:26.83] Pull off in that V8, songs on replay
[01:30.65] Spinnin' like a DJ, make it look easy
[01:49.15] 
[01:33.90] 'Cause I go faster and harder, faster and harder
[01:38.21] I go faster and harder, bitch, I feel like a monster
[01:42.04] I go faster and harder, f-f-f-faster and harder
[01:46.10] I go faster and harder, I-I-I feel like a monster
[02:10.60] 
[01:51.14] (Faster and harder, faster and harder)
[01:54.02] (I go faster and harder, bitch, I feel like a monster)
[01:58.07] (I go faster-, faster and harder)
[02:02.11] (I go faster and harder, I feel like a monster)
